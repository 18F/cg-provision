1. Create S3 bucket with versioning enabled to store BOSH manifest secrets for staging: `cloud-gov-varz-staging`
1. Create S3 bucket with versioning enabled to store BOSH releases and metadata: `cloud-gov-bosh-releases`
1. Create S3 bucket to store BOSH stemcell images: `cloud-gov-stemcell-images`

  1. Select `terraform-provision` pipeline in the menu
    1. Unpause the pipeline if paused
    1. Run the `bootstrap-tooling` job
    1. Make a note of all the outputs
      1. Modify the `cg-deploy-bosh.yml` you created earlier, and fill in with proper values from the outputs
      1. Re-upload `cg-deploy-bosh.yml` to the concourse credentials bucket
      1. Modify the `cg-deploy-concourse.yml` you created earlier, and fill in with proper values from the outputs
      1. Re-upload `cg-deploy-concourse.yml` to the concourse credentials bucket
  1. Select `bootstrap` pipeline in the menu
    1. Run the `bootstrap-bosh-pipeline` job
    1. Run the `bootstrap-concourse-pipeline` job
    1. Run the `setup-vpc-peering` job
  1. Select `deploy-bosh` pipeline in the menu
    1. Upload a JSON file called `master-bosh-state.json` with contents of just `{}` to the BOSH manifest secrets bucket
    1. Upload a properly filled and [encrypted secrets file](https://docs.cloud.gov/ops/updating-cf/#updating-secrets-yml) for masterbosh to the BOSH manifest secrets bucket
    1. Upload a [properly encrypted ssh key](https://github.com/18F/cg-pipeline-tasks/blob/master/generate_key.sh) for masterbosh to the BOSH manifest secrets bucket
    1. Unpause the pipeline if paused
    1. Run `deploy-master-bosh` job
    1. Upload a properly filled and [encrypted secrets file](https://docs.cloud.gov/ops/updating-cf/#updating-secrets-yml) for toolingbosh to the BOSH manifest secrets bucket
    1. Upload the CA cert for tooling bosh to the BOSH manifest secrets bucket
    1. Create S3 bucket for tooling bosh blobstore: `bosh-tooling-blobstore`
    1. Run `deploy-tooling-bosh` job
    1. Run `common-releases-tooling` job
  1. Select `deploy-concourse` pipeline in the menu
    1. Upload a properly filled and [encrypted secrets file](https://docs.cloud.gov/ops/updating-cf/#updating-secrets-yml) for staging concourse to the BOSH manifest secrets bucket
    1. Upload a properly filled and [encrypted secrets file](https://docs.cloud.gov/ops/updating-cf/#updating-secrets-yml) for production concourse to the BOSH manifest secrets bucket
    1. Unpause the pipeline if paused
    1. Ensure both `deploy-concourse-staging` and `deploy-concourse-production` jobs run successfully
  1. Select `bootstrap` pipeline in the menu
    1. Run the `teardown-vpc-peering` job
1. Run `./scripts/bootstrap.sh destroy`
1. Login to production concourse
1. Fly `./ci/pipeline.yml` with the `cg-provision.yml` credentials file you created earlier as `terraform-provision`
  1. Select and unpause the `terraform-provision` pipeline in the UI
  1. Run the `bootstrap-tooling` job and verify there are no changes
  1. Run both the `bootstrap-staging` and `bootstrap-production` jobs and verify they complete successfully
1. Iterate the rest of the infrastructure in the same way staring with `cg-deploy-bosh`:
  1. Update secrets for the environment and encrypt/upload to secrets bucket
  1. Update and upload the concourse pipeline credentials
  1. Update the pipeline to use proper stemcell
  1. Fly the pipeline
  1. Verify the pipeline runs successfully

  # Monitoring
  1. Create a Route 53 name for metrics.environment.cloud.gov
  1. Create an ELB to point to the 0.riemann.monitoring.monitoring-environment.bosh
  1. Point Route 53 name to ELB for HTTPS
